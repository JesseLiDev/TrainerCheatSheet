# TrainerCheats
#This program is designed to use the trainer app and pull down client information that is most valuable to the trainer

Key functionality:

-Grabs user authentication token by signing into the trainerize Web App

-Uses the token to make api requests to the Trainerize server to get information about every client in a matter of seconds

-Organizes and evaluates each client's actual nutrition, workout, and cardio data for the week against their goals so that they can see how well they performed for the week

-Generates a "Report Card" (report) for each client to be sent out, adding value to the service we provide to each client

How to use [Testing]
-Run GetLoginToken to get user login

-Edit data request to use the token, then set the user parameters to capture the days of whichever client you want
